## Exercises

1. Read the HTML content of the following URL with a variable called webpage: https://money.cnn.com/data/us_markets/ At this point, it will also be useful to open this web page in your browser.
```{r}
#install.packages("rvest") #install revest to read html files or webpages
library(rvest)
htmlLink <- "https://money.cnn.com/data/us_markets/"
webpage <- read_html(htmlLink)
```

2. Get the session details (status, type, size) of the above mentioned URL.
```{r}
#install.packages("rvest") #install rvest to get the session details of CNN Money webpage
#library(rvest)
html_session(htmlLink)
```

3. Extract all of the sector names from the “Stock Sectors” table (bottom left of the web page.)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#select only the names of the table "Stock Sectors" by extracting from the first element
html_table(html_nodes(webpage, "table"))[[2]][[1]]
```

4. Extract all of the “3 Month % Change” values from the “Stock Sectors” table.
```{r}
#select all the values from the "Stock Sectors" table by extracting from the second element
html_table(html_nodes(webpage, "table"))[[2]][[2]]
```

5. Extract the table “What’s Moving” (top middle of the web page) into a data-frame.
```{r}
#extract the first table by selecting the first element
html_table(html_nodes(webpage, "table"))[[1]]
```

6. Re-construct all of the links from the first column of the “What’s Moving” table.
Hint: the base URL is “https://money.cnn.com”
```{r}
# save all url links into table_link where css = td class wsod_symbol
table_links <- webpage %>% html_nodes(css = "td .wsod_symbol") %>% html_attr("href")

# Paste links to see all links from What's Moving table
paste("https://money.cnn.com", table_links, sep = "")
```

7. Extract the titles under the “Latest News” section (bottom middle of the web page.)
8. To understand the structure of the data in a web page, it is often useful to know what the underlying attributes are of the text you see.
Extract the attributes (and their values) of the HTML element that holds the timestamp underneath the “What’s Moving” table.
9. Extract the values of the blue percentage-bars from the “Trending Tickers” table (bottom right of the web page.)
Hint: in this case, the values are stored under the “class” attribute.
10. Get the links of all of the “svg” images on the web page.
